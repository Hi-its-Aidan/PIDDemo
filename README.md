# PIDDemo

This is a simple demonstration of a PID controller.
The user can adjust the gains using the three knobs at the bottom of the screen.
In order to establish the setpoint, users can hover their mouse over the gradiant bar at the top of the screen.
Clicking on the bar locks in the setpoint, which can be moved to the opposite side of the bar by pressing the space bar.
